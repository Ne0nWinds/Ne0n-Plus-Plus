# Ne0n-Plus-Plus
This is a collection of functions that I've found useful across multiple projects (WIP)

- Convenient types (`u32`, `s32`, `f32`, `f64`, etc.)
- Cross-platform UTF-8 string support (`string8`)
- Highly optimized math functions
- SIMD helper functions and operator overloads
- Random number generation (PCG, LCG, and Xorshift)
- Arena-style memory management
- Standard multithreaded work queue
- Windowing / Input
- File / IO
- Basic Sound Engine
- Easy Raytracing / Graphics
- Asset Processing (Uses third-party libraries)
- Profiling
